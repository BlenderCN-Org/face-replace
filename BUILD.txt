This project is setup to use Visual Studio's .prop files for including the required libraries (kinect, opencv, etc.)
If you don't know what this is, you should google it because it's a very flexible way of specifying the libraries required.

You will not be able to build my project without setting these libraries up, but for your convenience, I have provided the .prop files
which can be modified with a text editor.

TODO: Copy used .props files to the project folder
TODO: List all libraries used (and also versions)
